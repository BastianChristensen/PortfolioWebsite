<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>This is my personal portfolio website, built using Astro and deployed with Netlify. It took me around three weeks to complete, and it was my first real dive into web development — including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. One of the biggest challenges was getting the CSS to behave nicely across different screen sizes, but I learned a ton in the process.<br /><br /> Designing the site and writing the script was a lot of fun, and I’m really proud of how it turned out. This site will be a living project that I’ll keep updating with new projects, posts, and relevant updates as I go.</p>
